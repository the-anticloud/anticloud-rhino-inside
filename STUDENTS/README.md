## What this project gives you

A complete worked example of offline-first packaging with a cryptographic audit
chain: source pinned at `69c582bf7f10735b27ba07afd41e6a70b7a7534f`, a 16-check assurance suite, an evidence register
with per-check hashes, and an AIOSS ledger chain ending at `7a11af7231fadbde133dec2a2b29ea94b1d38c3848a86b3a0717abeafd30bd09`.

## Learn by verifying

```
python tools/run_bench.py --out BENCH.json
```

Then take any row from `ISOLATED_LAB_RESULTS/03_Result_Register.md`, recompute
the SHA3-256 of its evidence file, and confirm it matches. If it does not match,
the record has been altered — that is the whole point of the chain.
